    <summary>SkyFonts allows you to install fonts from participating sites such as google fonts and keep them up to date</summary>
    <description>## The simplest way to try, install, and manage fonts.

Install fonts from participating sites with a single click. Fonts are installed from the cloud on your computer in seconds.

## Great type should just work.
**Install and remove fonts from the cloud.**
No need to fill up your hard drive. Your fonts are available in the cloud, any time you need them, and you can easily remove fonts when you’re not using them.

**Try fonts in your design apps, before you buy.**
You shouldn’t have to spend hard-earned cash to find out if a font is going to work with your content. Font trials work with any desktop application, just like your regularly installed fonts.

**Subscribe to font libraries.**
On [participating sites](https://skyfonts.com/#font-providers), subscriptions powered by the SkyFonts service allow “all-you-can-eat” access to libraries of over 11,000 fonts.

## Fonts on your computer in seconds.
With the SkyFonts app installed on your Windows or Mac OSX system, you simply browse your favorite font websites to find the perfect font, then click the _Install_ button on the site. SkyFonts will download and activate your fonts in seconds.
